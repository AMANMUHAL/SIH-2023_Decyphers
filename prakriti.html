        <div class="intro-content"><p>According to Ayurveda, the human body is governed by three principal energies, also known as doshas. These doshas are Pitta, Vata and Kapha.
            Every individual has all three fundamental doshas; however, one dosha is more prominent than the rest. This prominent dosha determines the Ayurvedic body type or constitution, also known as Prakriti.
            Ancient wisdom defines the human body as a conglomeration of water, air, earth, fire, and ether. These 5 elements make up the human body and handle its functioning. However, all the elements must exist proportionally to ensure balance and stability. If this balance is disturbed beyond a certain point, the body may experience discomfort or collapse altogether.
            Further, Ayurveda groups these five elements into three fundamental energies, hence three body types: Kapha, pitta and Vata.
            Vata is the principal energy derived from air and ether elements; Kapha is water and earth; Pitta is fire and water.</p></div>
